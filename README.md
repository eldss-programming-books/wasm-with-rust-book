# wasm-with-rust-book
Programs and exercises produced by following the book "Programming Web Assembly With Rust" from the Pragmatic Programmer Bookshelf.

None of the code in this repo was created by me, but I have found the act of coding up the examples to be informative and helpful in learning the concepts.
