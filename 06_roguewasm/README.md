This chapter attempted a walkthrough of using wasm to create a terminal game, Rouge. I've not included any code here because I feel the chapter's code samples are confusing. The author does not walk through the whole program, instead assuming the reader should know what is going on. It is very difficult to follow without copy/pasting large chunks of code from the book's source files. This defeats the purpose of coding along.
